There is also a tab for sample interview questions but if you use the Behavorial Question tab, make sure to keep scrolling the the left, there is quite a bit of content, and because of the formatting its easy to miss.

Overall easy to use with clear instructions. Would suggest redoing the format for the behavioral questions tab to be scrollable up and down not right to left. Suggestion tab is a great idea, but only if consistent follow-up is done, and would be great if there were timestamps to notify when suggestions was looked and responded to. 
Would be great to have more generic examples for different roles (e.g. Product, UI/UX).

The page contains links to the support structure they used to achieve their outcomes (where to start at freecodecamp.org, community freecodecamp group, brigades homepage with projects that the graduates could go on to).  More context about the program, is availble on their Brigade Captain's personal blog: pamelawoodbrowne.org and in a slide deck presented November 2018.

It would be usefull if a copy of the proposal and contract that was used in funding this program was available as well as user research with the participatnts to find out their painpoints/opportunities/learning.  Stats on the program are: 
200 through the program
50% of first cohort were women
18 people are reported as finishing the FCC certificate
8 that are still using GitHub significally (more than 2 times) in 2021

The wiki links to closed issues, where you can see some concrete examples of resolved proposals.  The issues don't have size labels, which would be helpful, but you can review the issues and gague size for yourself based on the the size of the original comment and comments that follow.  We have selected some examples: Small, Medium, Large 

One of the issues is a propsoal to use the Fist-to-Five process.  This issue would make an excellent Template for starting your own first proposal which could be used in conjunction with the related slide deck asset from Michelle and Bonnie which gives a deeper overview and group workshop activity which demonstrates how to conduct the practice.  ",Michelle says that she still uses this sysytem within a small group of hers but it is a vartiation of Fist-to-5. She also agrees that this should be revisited with an update.-* Note per Mary,,1,-
